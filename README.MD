- A site that helped me figure out my grids was Developer Mozilla
[grid-template](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid-template-columns)

- One technical issue I had with this site was that the boxes were going inside of each other. I figured out after some research and looking back at earlier classes that the max width in the figure had to be larger than the grid.

- Another problem I had was when I set the max-width in the footer, the text all went to the left. I figured out if I set the margin to 0, it will stay in the middle
